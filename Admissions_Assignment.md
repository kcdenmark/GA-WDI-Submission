## WDI Admissions Assignment

We'd love to learn more about you and your interest in programming to make sure you are the right fit for the program. In order to be successful in WDI, you really need to like programming, and the only way to know is to try it.

We'd like you to dip your toes in HTML and CSS in preparation for your interview. Specifically, we'd like you to:

* **Complete the introductory tutorials on Dash.** Please complete all parts of the first two projects - you'll learn how to create a simple personal website and build a responsive blog. Sign up [here](http://dash.generalassemb.ly/?vip=true)
* **Get set up with your own environment.** Watch the video [here](http://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/qzig8mp4mv) to learn how to get set up with your own text editor on your computer and start writing your own HTML and CSS files.
* **Build your own basic single-page "About Me" website using HTML and CSS.** This site is separate from the two projects you created as part of the DASH tutorials. The website should include both content using HTML and styling using CSS. Make sure to include:
	* A section telling us more about you
	* A picture of you
	* A section with your contact information

We are NOT testing your programming aptitude, so don't worry if you are new and don't have the most advanced or polished site in the world. What we REALLY want to see is your intellectual curiosity and resourcefulness. See if you can go above and beyond and impress us! During your interview, we'll be asking about what you tried and learned along the way. Try to get through the whole admissions assignment on your own (Google is a fine resource).

We expect the assignment to take you 6 - 10 hours. When you are done, zip/compress your folder and send it to [wdi_admissions@generalassemb.ly](mailto:wdi_admissions@generalassemb.ly). If you're not sure how to zip a folder, check out [this site](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/159).

If you have questions about the DASH tool itself, feel free to email the help listed on DASH. If you have questions about the WDI Admissions process, please reach out to the admissions officer you have been in touch with. If you are stuck in the assignment, try to get through it on your own, and then try Google :) 

Good luck!
