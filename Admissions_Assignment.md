## WDI Admissions Assignment

Congratulations on making it to the second round of the admissions process for Web Development Immersive (WDI) at General Assembly!  We'd love to learn more about you and your interest in programming.  In order to be successful in WDI, you really have to enjoy programming, and the only way to truly know that is for you to try it.  With that in mind, we’d like you to do some coding before your next interview, and then chat with us about your work.   Specifically, we'd like you to:

1. First, complete the introductory tutorials on [Dash](https://dash.generalassemb.ly/).  Please complete **all** parts of the first two projects –- you'll learn how to create a simple personal website and build a responsive blog.  The other sections are certainly helpful, but you won’t need to incorporate what you learn from part 3 onwards into your personal website.

2. Get set up with your own environment. Watch the video [here](http://generalassembly.wistia.com/medias/qzig8mp4mv) to learn how to set up a text editor on your computer and start writing your own HTML and CSS files.

3. Build your own single-page "About Me" website using HTML and CSS.  You’ll use what you learned from Dash in this part, but you can't submit what you coded with Dash!  Your website should implement both HTML and CSS styling. Make sure to include:

	- A section telling us more about you
	- A picture of yourself
	- A section with your contact information

We expect the assignment to take you 6 - 10 hours. When you are done, zip/compress folder and send it to wdi_admissions@generalassemb.ly. If you're not sure how to zip a folder, check out [this site](http://www.macinstruct.com/node/159).

We are not testing your programming aptitude, so don't worry if you are new and don't have the most advanced or polished site in the world. We want to see your intellectual curiosity, resourcefulness, and programming potential.  By looking at your code and talking with you about it, we’ll be able to see how you think and work with code.  Please feel free to focus just on making something simple that works, but if you can go above and beyond and impress us, it certainly won’t hurt your application!  During your interview, we'll use this project as a starting point for a conversation about what you tried and learned along the way, your approach form a coding point of view, and what else you'd like to do with it.

If you have questions about the Dash tool, please email the help resources on Dash. If you have questions about the WDI admissions process, please reach out to the admissions officer with whom you have been in touch.  If you are stuck in the assignment, try to get through it on your own.  If you’re really stuck, Google can help!

Good luck!
